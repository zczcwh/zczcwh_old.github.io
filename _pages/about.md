# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I'm a Ph.D. student at [Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV)](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/) of University of Central Florida (UCF) with [Prof. Chen Chen](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/chenchen/) since Fall 2021. Before joining UCF, I obtained my Master's degree in Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Tufts University in Aug 2019, advised by [Prof. Shuchin Aeron](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/~shuchin/) and [Prof. Eric Miller](https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/eric-miller). I received my Bachelor's Degree in Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Bridgeport in May 2016, advised by [Prof. Xingguo Xiong](https://www.bridgeport.edu/faculty/xingguo-michael-xiong). I also received my Bachelor's Degree in School of Information Science and Engineering at Wuhan University of Science and Technology in June 2016.
